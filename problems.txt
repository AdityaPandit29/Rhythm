1. date inconsistency due ISOstring -> i used localDateString in sweden format ("sv-SE"). i used this because it is easier to parse to a date object.
2. problem of not getting any meaningfull free time(why is the user living???) -> tasks will be scheduled only in a specific window which is of 7 days before the deadline
3. Overlapping dur to wrong overnight logic on poorly designed tables -> changed tables
4. when an auto task is going on then if we add a manual block whose start time is later than the end time of the ongoing task, then the task is getting resheduled due to rebalancing.
5. if i obly use react hooks for streaks logic then i will fail if i close my app. i need seesion table to store data
6. if i update the last_done_date instantly when the habit is started within the start window then i have to keep my app open till the habit end in order to update the streak. -> keep another attribute in the habits table last_counted_on. so now if the app reopens after the schedule then also i can check previous schedule date using last counted_on and if it is same as last_done_date then i will update streak and change last_done_date as last_counted_on.
7. notifications dont work when app is killed. -> we need a server or pre schedule notifications(OS works here).
8. expo go is suited for notifications. i need to build the app and communicate directly with the OS. then use notifications. 
9. why am I rescheduling notifications on app start. -> so that it could schedule habits as they are only scheduled for next 7 days.


IMPORTANT POINTS - 
useEffect depends on mounting, while useFocusEffect depends on navigation focus. Screens are lazy-loaded by default, so useEffect doesn’t run until the screen is mounted.
