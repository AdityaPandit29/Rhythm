# Rhythm  
### A Unified Productivity Engine for Habits, Routines & Tasks

Rhythm is a smart productivity app built with React Native that combines **habit tracking, time blocks, and task management** into one intelligent scheduling system.

Unlike traditional productivity apps that separate these features, Rhythm merges everything into a single scheduling engine to reduce mental load, prevent task pile-up, and build long-term discipline.

---

## 🚀 Why Rhythm?

Most productivity apps treat habits, routines, and tasks as separate modules.  
Rhythm integrates them into one unified engine that:

- Prevents scheduling conflicts  
- Automatically reschedules tasks  
- Tracks streaks and late status  
- Syncs notifications in real-time  
- Dynamically maps weekly schedules to real calendar dates  

Result → **Consistency without cognitive overload.**

## 🧠 Intelligent Scheduling Logic

Rhythm uses a logic-first architecture:

- Weekday-based blocks dynamically converted to real dates
- Current block state computed in real time
- Late habit detection algorithm
- Auto-rescheduling engine
- Notification lifecycle management

This makes the app behave like a **mini productivity operating system.**
