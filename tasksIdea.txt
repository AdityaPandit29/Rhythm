✅ Final Recommended Design for Tasks (Based on Your Idea)
1️⃣ Task Name

Simple and required.

2️⃣ Monthly Task (Optional)

A toggle or dropdown:

If ON → repeats every month on the chosen date

If OFF → normal single task

Keep this optional for now (good decision).

3️⃣ Deadline (Date + Time)

This is extremely important because:

Auto-scheduler needs a boundary

Priority decisions depend on it

Helps prevent overdue tasks

✔ Keep deadline mandatory if autoschedule is ON
✔ Optional if autoschedule is OFF

4️⃣ Priority (Low, Medium, High)

This priority feeds into the scheduler:

High Priority

Can override habits

Can override low/medium tasks

Gets earliest available free block

If “urgent,” it may cut into flexible habits

Medium Priority

Schedules around habits

But can push low-priority tasks

Low Priority

Gets leftover time

Never overrides habits

Scheduled only when space available

This is perfect. Keep it.

5️⃣ Auto-Schedule Toggle

This is the MOST important piece. Your logic is very good.

🔵 If Auto-Schedule = ON

User enters:

✔ Approx Duration

e.g., 20, 45, 120 minutes

If duration = 0 →
Meaning: "No timer needed. Just place this task somewhere free."

UI can show:

“Rhythm will place this task in a free time block.”

✔ No need to select time

You will compute best time based on:

Free spaces between habits

Priority

Deadline

User's preferred productive hours (optional future feature)

🔴 If Auto-Schedule = OFF

User manually sets:

Start Time

End Time

And this overrides scheduling logic but still respects:

No overlap

No conflict with fixed habits

Optional: Warn if it clashes with flexible auto habits

🧠 Why your idea is excellent

Because it creates a unified logic:

Habits = repeated routines

Have “auto-schedule” toggle

Tasks = single items with a deadline

Also have “auto-schedule” toggle

But with priority rules

The biggest difference:

Habits care about consistency and time of day

Tasks care about deadline and priority

And your design respects that.
